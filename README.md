## What it does
Searches for and displays nearby points of interest and places to visit. The user can save places to their personal list and pick from bot suggestions. The user builds a travel itinerary by dragging places into the calendar view. The app shows transportation distances and times (supplied by the Google Directions API) between calendar items. It shows the forecasted temperature*, precipitation*, and sunrise and sunset times* throughout each day of the user’s trip. Dragging and dropping places (e.g. hotels) into the boxes between days makes the app calculate when the traveler will need to leave their hotel and when they’ll get back.

*Not yet implemented. Refer to the challenges section.

## Challenges we ran into
- Coming up with a project idea took hours. We had lots of ideas that were just bad.
- My teammate had to leave the hackathon and wasn't able to develop for the majority of the duration. Because of this, I had to drop some of the best features that we planned to add.

## What's next for Jyrni
- Real weather API data as opposed to the mock data in the demo
- Better UI
- Functioning backend and user account system with Firebase Cloud Store
